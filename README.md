# wireframing
Wireframing is the design process of creating a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. 
It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key elements of wireframing
Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

### Exmples of wireframes
The wireframe in the given example is a high-fidelity wireframe as there is the presence of images and navigation buttons to show flow from one screen to another.
One can also tell that the images are refined and not just place holders, the colors used match and there is the utilization of more than one font type.

## Figma for wireframing
Instead of using old methods of sketching wireframes by hand using a blank sheet or computer paper, or dot grid journals modern methods have given us tools like figma. For those that want to jump into designing on-screen, Figma has a wireframe template to get you started. Figma is browser-based, so sharing your wireframes is as easy as sharing a link therefore enhancing collaboration among team members. Your team can leave comments right on the file so you can easily get feedback and field questions.
