# wireframing
Wireframing is the design process of creating a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. 
It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key elements of wireframing
Layout Structure: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
Navigation: Shows how users will move through the site or application.
Content Placement: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
Functionality: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

## Types of Wireframes
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without detailed design.
High-Fidelity Wireframes: More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific layout and design elements.

### Exmples of wireframes
The wireframe in the given example is a high-fidelity wireframe as there is the presence of images and navigation buttons to show flow from one screen to another.
One can also tell that the images are refined and not just place holders, the colors used match and there is the utilization of more than one font type.

## Popular Wireframing tools
Popular tools used in wireframing include; Figma, Miro, Sketch, UXPin, Balsamiq, and the oldschool pen and paper
### Figma for wireframing
Instead of using old methods of sketching wireframes by hand using a blank sheet or computer paper, or dot grid journals modern methods have given us tools like figma. For those that want to jump into designing on-screen, Figma has a wireframe template to get you started. Figma is browser-based, so sharing your wireframes is as easy as sharing a link therefore enhancing collaboration among team members. Your team can leave comments right on the file so you can easily get feedback and field questions.

## Benefits of Wireframing
1. Clarifies Ideas and Concepts:
Wireframing helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations. It allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the layout and structure of a project early in the process.

2. Facilitates Communication:
It serves as a communication tool among team members, clients, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the design and functionality.

3. Identifies Usability Issues:
By focusing on the user interface structure, wireframing helps identify potential usability issues early on. This can include navigation problems, information hierarchy issues, and interaction flaws.

4. Saves Time and Resources:
Early detection of design flaws and usability issues saves time and resources that would be spent on revisions later in the design and development stages.

5. Provides a Clear Layout and Structure:
Wireframes provide a clear and simple representation of the layout, allowing designers to plan the content placement and prioritize elements effectively.

6. Enables Easy Modifications:
Making changes to a wireframe is quicker and less costly than altering a high-fidelity design or a developed product. This flexibility encourages experimentation and iterative improvement.

7. Guides the Design Process:
Wireframes act as a guide for subsequent design and development phases, ensuring that the final product aligns with the initial vision and requirements.

8.Focuses on Functionality and User Experience:
By stripping away visual design elements, wireframes allow designers to concentrate on the functionality and user experience, ensuring the product is intuitive and user-friendly.
